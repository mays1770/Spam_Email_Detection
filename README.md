# Spam_Email_Detection
The dataset can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
I used common machine learning algorithms such as lightGBM, SVM and tried stacking to classify spam vs. non-spam emails. 
The evaluation is based on overall accuracy and cost analysis. I also considered precision, recall, f1-score, ROC curves and other metrics in deciding the final model.
